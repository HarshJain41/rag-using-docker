            "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating relevant retrieval techniques. RAG methods retrieve pertinent documents or text to provide additional context during the generation process, ensuring the LLMs generate relevant and coherent responses that align with the original input query. Different types of RAG techniques include VectorRAG, Realm, and HybridRAG, each with its own strengths and limitations. \n"
